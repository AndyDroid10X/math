## Euler's Formula Cheat Sheet

**Euler's Formula** is a fundamental theorem in mathematics that connects complex numbers, trigonometry, and exponential functions. It states that:

$$e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$$

where $i$ is the imaginary unit, $e$ is the base of the natural logarithm, $x$ is any real number, and $\cos$ and $\sin$ are the cosine and sine functions, respectively.

### Key Concepts

- **Complex numbers**: A complex number $z$ is a number of the form $z = a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit, which satisfies $i^2=-1$.
- **Exponential function**: The exponential function $e^x$ is defined for any real number $x$ and is the function that satisfies the property that its derivative is equal to itself: $\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$.
- **Trigonometric functions**: The sine and cosine functions are fundamental trigonometric functions that relate angles and sides in a right triangle. They have many applications in geometry, physics, and engineering.

### Key Formulas

- **Euler's Formula**: $e^{ix} = \cos(x) + i\sin(x)$
- **Euler's Identity**: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$
- **De Moivre's Formula**: $(\cos(x) + i\sin(x))^n = \cos(nx) + i\sin(nx)$
- **Complex conjugate**: For a complex number $z = a + bi$, its complex conjugate is $\bar{z} = a - bi$.
- **Modulus**: For a complex number $z = a + bi$, its modulus is $|z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

### Key Properties

- **Euler's Formula and trigonometry**: Euler's Formula provides a way to express trigonometric functions in terms of complex exponentials: $\cos(x) = \frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}$ and $\sin(x) = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}$.
- **Euler's Formula and geometry**: Euler's Formula provides a way to represent complex numbers in the complex plane: the real part of $e^{ix}$ gives the $x$-coordinate and the imaginary part gives the $y$-coordinate of the point corresponding to $e^{ix}$.
- **Euler's Identity and geometry**: Euler's Identity relates the most fundamental constants in mathematics: $0$, $1$, $e$, $i$, and $\pi$. It has deep connections to geometry, number theory, and physics.
- **De Moivre's Formula and trigonometry**: De Moivre's Formula provides a way to find powers of complex numbers in polar form: $(\cos(x) + i\sin(x))^n = \cos(nx) + i\sin(nx)$.
- **Complex conjugate and modulus**: The complex conjugate of a complex number $z$ is obtained by changing the sign of its imaginary part, and its modulus is the distance from $z$ to the origin in the complex plane. The product of a complex number and its conjugate is always a real number: $z\bar{z} = |z|^2$.

### Key Applications

- **Signal processing**: Euler's Formula provides a way to represent periodic signals as a sum of complex exponentials, which is useful in Fourier analysis and signal processing.
- **Engineering**: Complex numbers are used extensively in electrical engineering to represent signals, impedances, and transfer functions.
- **Quantum mechanics**: Complex numbers are used to represent quantum states and quantum operators in quantum mechanics, and Euler's Formula plays a central role in the theory of quantum mechanics.
- **Number theory**: Euler's Identity is related to the famous Euler's totient function, which counts the number of integers less than a given number that are relatively prime to it. It also has deep connections to the Riemann hypothesis and the distribution of prime numbers.
